# LibraryManagementSim
A Library Management System with additional Simulation functionality.

This Library Management System was an exploration of the various data structures I learnt. The
Data Strcutures used include Hash Maps, Tree Maps, Queues, Array Lists, and Arrays.

The Library Management System further includes simulation functionality, allowing for admins
to runs simulations for a set number of days and analyse various information such as the
most issued author, the book with the most number of checkouts, and mudch more.

Admins can add and delete users, adjust the chuckout limit for users, add and delete books,
and run simulations (as previously states). They can also notify users who default on their
turn in dates of this.

Users can check out books, return books, and inspect the book catalog.
